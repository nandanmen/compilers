import { BoxAnimation } from "./BoxAnimation";
import { Figure } from "./Figure";

Great work! There you have it — your first animation with Framer
Motion. Before we move on, let's break down that animation. How did we
go from the `animate` prop to the animation that you saw?

Here's the code from before:

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export function Box() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      animate={{
        x: 500,
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

The `animate` prop is used to define the end state of the animation — what properties the component should have once the animation ends. In our animation above, we're saying to animate the `Box` from its current position to `x: 500`.

<Figure>
  <BoxAnimation />
</Figure>

The `animate` prop is also _reactive_, meaning every time the value changes the component will animate to the new value. Try clicking on the button below to change the value of `animate` in the code:
